	<h3>By Siles Modisett, January 14, 2020.</h3>
	<p>The growth of the web over the last couple of decades has brought with it some new job titles. For example, had anyone ever heard of a webmaster prior to the mid-1990s?

Over the last two decades, they've added Websites to their repertoire.</p>

	<p>Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients. Web developers often are implementing ideas that others may have even those others lack the technical know-how to turn those ideas into an actual, functional website. Web developers build and shape visitors’ experiences at websites. They do this through the creation of page layouts (headings and paragraphs), website styling (colors and fonts), and page features (animations and pictures). Interactive features, such as submitting online payments securely, are a necessary feature of e-commerce sites. In some settings, web developers can get started with no more than a high school diploma, but an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree typically is needed to advance in the field. This job generally requires the ability to do the following work:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Graphic design</li>
	<li>Know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other relevant web design coding languages</li>
	<li>Collaborate</li>

	<li>Troubleshoot website problems</li>
	<li>Maintain and update websites</li>
	<li>Stay up-to-date on technology</li>	
	</ul>
